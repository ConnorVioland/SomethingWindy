Pseudocode for WindPower use:

if (keyPower == down) && (powerCurrent > powerMinimum){		//Minimum power would be ~10% of Tier1 MaxPower. MaxPower increases with Tier?
	int waypointCount = 0;
	powerTemp = powerCurrent;				//Holds original power value for later
	do {
		every X ticks or Y disance, create waypoint 	//Invisible points or floating, glowing game object
								//Not every tick (probably would lag the game creating splines)
		powerTemp -= (powerMinimum/2); 			//Minimum of two points able to be created
		waypointCount += 1;
		UpdatePowerMeterDisplay();			//Could be a UI feature or the artifact glowing
		powerEnd = true;
	} while ((keyPower == down) && (powerTemp  >= 0))
}
if (powerEnd == true) && (waypointCount < 2){			//If player misclicked and only made one point, all power cost is refunded
	Remove Waypoints					//Gameobjects and waypointCount
	powerTemp = powerCurrent;
	powerEnd == false;
}
else if (powerEnd == true){
	Create spline through waypoints				
	Remove Waypoints
	Create Gust gameobject from spline					
	powerCurrent = powerTemp;
	powerEnd == false;
}
